# Playlist Analyzer for Spotify


*Need a playlist for a group study session that you'll all enjoy? Want a custom generated playlist based on the audio featurjes of your Top 100 songs? Interested in learning more about your music taste?* 

This project gives solutions to these problems and more. Inspired by Spotify's 2017 Wrapped feature, I set out to see what insights could be extracted from different users' Top 100 playlists. I gathered Top 100 playlists from 11 other Spotify users, and began working on various functions using the Spotify API to see what could be done with the data.

If you use Spotify as much as I do, your Top 100 playlist is a good representation of your musical tastes. Is it possible for a computer to automatically identify your taste in music, generate playlists you'll enjoy, compare your tastes with your friends? The answer to all these questions is yes.

This project started out as simply counting which artists had the most tracks in a playlist, however it quickly grew to using machine learning to generate a playlist that best fits your musical tastes, clustering the data using different audio features, and creating playlists of the most danceable or study-able tracks from each input playlist. Although these are the major functions so far, the possibilities of what to do with this data are endless, and there are a plethora of fun and useful potential features for end-users waiting to be made using this sort of analysis. 


This project is built around the Spotify Python Wrapper, [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy), using various tools including [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). *Note: Although much of this project is designed with Top 100 playlists in mind, it is still generally applicable to any playlist(s) used as input.*


## Features
Several different useful features are provided in this project, see the Usage and Sample Output sections for instructions on how to use each feature, and example results.
##### Classification and Playlist Prediction

Train a model to predict which playlist a track comes from based on its audio features. The trained model can then be used to generate a playlist of tracks that would likely be from a given playlist, in other words, tracks that the user would enjoy since they are musically similar to the songs in their Top 100 list. Any combination of audio features can be used in the training and prediction.

Either a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier (*sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier*) or a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (*sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB*) can be used as the model, however I have found that the MLP classifier performs better on this dataset, correctly labeling ~35% of the dataset. This may seem low, however randomly assigning labels would result in ~8% accuracy since there are 12 possible playlists to chose from. When you also take into account that some of these 12 users have similar music tastes, a wrong classification could still assign the track to someone who would enjoy it, just not the playlist where it was originally found.

##### Dance Party and Study Buddies Playlist Generators
Another neat feature is generating a custom playlist for either dancing or studying, using some tracks from each input playlist. For example, if 4 friends are studying together and want to play music they will all enjoy, this tool would automatically generate a playlist to fit all their needs. 

The dance party function uses a combination of the danceability and energy audio features to chose the tracks, while study buddies uses instrumentalness, acousticness, energy, and speechiness. These combinations of audio features make sense, at least in my opinion, for creating a playlist conducive to dancing or studying. 

##### Top Artists in a Playlist
This feature extracts the artists who show up most often in a given playlist, and displays their names and how many songs they are responsible for. It takes into account the fact that songs can have more than one artist, and also shows the total number of artists who were present in the playlist. Although technically less advance than the previous two features, this feature was requested by some of the users who sent me their Top 100 lists, and I was also curious about my own playlist.
##### Cluster Visualization
Clustering can be performed on the data, using any combination of audio features. After the clusters are found, several plots are created and shown to the user. The first shows the cluster distribution for each playlist, to reaffirm the belief that different users' playlists have very different audio trends. After that initial plot is displayed, a scatter plot is shown for each pair of audio features. The features used in plotting can also be customized, and an x or y-axis feature can be specified so that only the plots with that feature are shown (i.e. if you only wanted to see plots with *valence* on the y-axis). 





## Usage
To use the script use `python playlist_analyzer.py` with any of the following sets of parameters (Optional parameters are in square brackets):

* `-h` or `--help`
  * *Shows a help message.*

* `-g [-p Playlist_CSV_Filename] [-n Number_Of_Songs_To_Include]`
  *	*Generates a playlist similar to the given playlist using a neural network.*
  *	*A multilayer perceptron classifier is trained to predict which playlist each track comes from based on its audio features. Then the trained model selects the tracks, from all available playlists, that it deems most likely to be from the given playlist (AKA tracks the user would like, since they are musically similar to their Top 100 list) and creates a Spotify playlist of these tracks.*
  *	*Note: The -p argument expects the name of the CSV file containing the audio analysis of the tracks in the playlist, not the playlist ID/URI.*

* `-d [-n Number_Songs_From_Each] [-p Playlist_CSV_Names]`
	* *Generates a 'Dance Party' playlist from given Playlist CSV file names, picking n 'danceable' songs from each source playlist.*
	* *Note: The -p argument expects playlist CSV file names (not playlist ID/URIs) and should be a comma separated list.*

* `-s [-n Number_Songs_From_Each] [-p Playlist_CSV_Names]`
	* *Generates a 'Study Buddies' playlist from given Playlist CSV file names, picking n 'study-able' songs from each source playlist.*
	* *Note: The -p argument expects playlist CSV file names (not playlist ID/URIs) and should be a comma separated list.*

* `-a [-p Playlist_ID] [-n Number_Of_Artists_To_Display]`
	* *Shows top occurring n Artists in a Playlist (defaults to showing all artists present in the playlist in order if n is not specified).*

* `-w [-p Playlist_ID]`
	* *Writes a CSV file of audio features and metadata for the given playlist.*
	* *Defaults to creating a CSV file for each of the user's playlist with 'Top 100' in the name if no argument is provided.*

* `-c [-a Algorithm] [-n Number_Of_Clusters]`
	* *Performs clustering with given algorithm {'GMM' or 'spectral'} and the specified number of clusters.*

* *Running with no command line arguments will execute unit testing of the various functions.*

*Note: The following environment variables must be set in order to run the script locally:*
`SPOTIFY_USERNAME, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
